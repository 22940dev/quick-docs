# Introduction

Welcome to your new QuickDocs website.

## Tour

Let's take a quick tour of the project folder.

### Content

```js
├── content/ // highlight-line
│   ├─ docs/
│   ├─ nav/
│   └─ index.mdx
└── src/
```

The **Content** folder is where y ou define the content for your site. Any
[Markdown React](https://mdxjs.com/) files (`.mdx`) will be automatically
converted into pages like this one.

The page's URL will be determined by its path relative to the content folder.
For example, `/content/docs/button.mdx` will turn into a page with the URL
`myDocs.com/docs/button`.

The landing page (the one you're reading now) is defined at `index.mdx`. As with
any folder, an `index.mdx` will be available at the parent folder's URL. For
example, `/content/myFolder/index.mdx` would turn into a page with the url
`myDocs.com/myFolder/`.

### Nav

```js
├── content/
│   ├─ docs/
│   ├─ nav/  // highlight-line
│   └─ index.mdx
└── src/
```

The **nav** folder (or rather, the `content/nav` folder) contains three files
that define different parts of your website's navigation As the file names
suggest:

- `header.mdx` defines the page's header content,
- `sidebar.mdx` defines the site's sidebar, and
- `footer.mdx` defines the site's footer.

The sidebar's links are _not_ automatically generated. If you add a new page to
your project, you'll need to open `sidebar.mdx` and add a link to that page.

### Src

```js
├── content/
└── src/      // highlight-line
    ├─ components/
    ├─ templates/
    ├─ index.js
    └─ theme.js
```

The **src** folder contains the rest of the projects's source code. If you want
to change how the site looks or works, then here's where to make those changes.

This project uses a development that that includes:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/)

The easiest place to start would be `theme.js`, which defines the site's theme
using the [System UI Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec).

## Editing

For editing, I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
(or VSCode).

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. In the VSCode menu, select **File > Open** and select your project's folder.
3. To get help editing your `.mdx` files, install the
   [MDX plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silvenon.mdx).
4. Edit or add `.mdx` files in your projects `content` folder.

To see your changes live in the browser, you can start the project on a
development server. With the project folder open in VSCode:

1. Open the integrated terminal by selecting **View > Terminal**.
2. In the terminal, type `npm start` and press Enter.
3. When the project is ready, open the url shown in your browser. Most likely,
   this URL will be `http://localhost:8000/`.

To stop your server, press `control + c` in the terminal or just close your
VSCode window.

## Publishing

To publish this project on the web, run `npm run build` in the terminal. This
will create a production-ready website in your project's `public` folder. You
have many ways to share this folder with the web, but here's one:

- Run `npm run build` to create your `public` folder.
- Open your browser and visit [Netlify Drop](http://netlify.com/drop).
- Open your project folder in Finder.
- Drag the entire `public` folder onto the Netlify Drop page.

This will create a hosted copy of your project. (The URL will be random, though
you can change it under Site Settings.) You can read more about hosting on
Netlify [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/hosting-on-netlify/).
