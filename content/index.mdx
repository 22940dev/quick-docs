# Introduction

Welcome to your new QuickDocs website.

## Tour

Let's take a quick tour of the project folder.

### Content

```js
├── content/ // highlight-line
│   ├─ docs/
│   ├─ nav/
│   └─ index.mdx
└── src/
```

The **Content** folder is where y ou define the content for your site. Any
[Markdown React](https://mdxjs.com/) files (`.mdx`) will be automatically
converted into pages like this one.

The page's URL will be determined by its path relative to the content folder.
For example, `/content/docs/button.mdx` will turn into a page with the URL
`myDocs.com/docs/button`.

The landing page (the one you're reading now) is defined at `index.mdx`. As with
any folder, an `index.mdx` will be available at the parent folder's URL. For
example, `/content/myFolder/index.mdx` would turn into a page with the url
`myDocs.com/myFolder/`.

### Nav

```js
├── content/
│   ├─ docs/
│   ├─ nav/  // highlight-line
│   └─ index.mdx
└── src/
```

The **nav** folder (or rather, the `content/nav` folder) contains three files
that define different parts of your website's navigation As the file names
suggest:

- `header.mdx` defines the page's header content,
- `sidebar.mdx` defines the site's sidebar, and
- `footer.mdx` defines the site's footer.

The sidebar's links are _not_ automatically generated. If you add a new page to
your project, you'll need to open `sidebar.mdx` and add a link to that page.

### Src

```js
├── content/
└── src/      // highlight-line
    ├─ components/
    ├─ templates/
    ├─ index.js
    └─ theme.js
```

The **src** folder contains the rest of the projects's source code. If you want
to change how the site looks or works, then here's where to make those changes.

This project uses a development that that includes:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/)

The easiest place to start would be `theme.js`, which defines the site's theme
using the [System UI Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec).
